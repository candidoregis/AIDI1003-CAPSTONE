In summary, we built a complete AI-assisted Applicant Tracking System by first cleaning and preprocessing our resume data, then fine-tuning a BERT-based model for matching resumes to job descriptions. After that, we deployed the model using Flask, defining endpoints that allow real-time predictions. Finally, our client application shows how other systems can consume our API. This approach not only automates resume screening but also creates a scalable, modular system that can be integrated into modern recruitment workflows
